# Machine_Learning_Module_End_Project_Predicting_Car_Price
-------------------------------------------

Project Overview :
----------------
 A comprehensive machine learning analysis to help a Chinese automobile company understand pricing dynamics in the US market for their market entry strategy. This project implements and compares multiple regression algorithms to predict car prices and identify key factors affecting pricing in the American automotive market.

Business Objective :
--------------------
Primary Goal: Understand factors affecting car pricing in the American market to inform:

* Manufacturing unit setup decisions
* Local production strategies
* Competitive pricing against US and European manufacturers
* Product design and business strategy optimization

Dataset :
---------
* Source: Market survey data from American automobile market
* Size: Multiple car types and models across various price segments
* Features: 25+ attributes including technical specifications, design features, and performance metrics
* Target Variable: Car price in USD

Technical Implementation: 
-------------------------
Machine Learning Models Implemented

* Linear Regression - Baseline interpretable model
* Decision Tree Regressor - Non-linear relationships
* Random Forest Regressor - Ensemble method for robustness
* Gradient Boosting Regressor - Sequential error correction
